## What next? (as of 11th January 2023)

I've started work on Character Inventory and Item-Handling.

Initially I am planning to remake Wizardry 1, then adding 2 and 3, and then subsequently providing infinite procedurally-generated content like that of Diablo for example. In the meantime, check out Snarfu's bugfix and recompilation of the original Wizardry for Apple II at <https://github.com/snafaru>.

## Compilation

I 'm currently developing solely on Linux (Ubuntu 22) so compilation instructions are currently Linux-specific. Windows instructions and releases will of course be supported at a later date.

Full compliation instructions for Linux are in the doc/COMPILE text file, but in brief both CMake (via VSCode CMake Tools) and Code::Blocks are supported. C++20 compiler support is required.

All code is released under the GPL - see the doc/LICENSE text file for full details.

## Contact and Help

All comments and criticism and help welcome. You can find me as *Typhon* on the C++ help, SFML, and DungeonCrawlers.org Discord Servers, or my email address is on the Splash Screen of the Game.
