# Sorcery: Shadows under Llylgamyn

An open source remake of Wizardry 1,2,3 (and 5) with infinite (proc-genned)
Dungeon Adventures, and (optional) modern CRPG conveniences! I'm aiming to
release it by the end of the year. Its coded using C++20 and SFML. Whilst
eventually the game engine will be (optionall) fully 3D, I need to spend time
learning OpenGL properly, and for the moment the dungeon is rendered using the
old-school Painters Algorithm method (used in classics such as Eye of the
Beholder and The Bard's Tale) to faithfully reproduce the wireframe graphics of
the originals.

Hopefully soon, there will be a playable game! Visit back regularily for
updates. Initially the focus will be on emulating Wizardry 1 fully, then 2, 3, 5
and maybe even 4 some day.

## What next? (as of December 2022)

I'm currently implementing Inn/Temple functionality.

Next stop after that will be items, creatures, magic and combat. Then there might
be something playable here! Then, as mentioned above, a proper 3D renderer will
probably be implemented.

Initially I am planning to remake Wizardrys 1, 2, and 3, and subsequently
providing infinite procedurally-generated content like that of Diablo for example.

In the meantime, check out Snarfu's bugfix and recompilation of the original
Wizardry for Apple II at <https://github.com/snafaru>.

## Compilation

Note that I'm currently developing solely on Linux (Ubuntu 20) so compilation
instructions are currently Linux-specific. Windows instructions and releases
will of course be supported at a later date.

Full compliation instructions for Linux are in the doc/COMPILE text file, but in
brief both CMake (via VSCode CMake Tools) and Code::Blocks are supported.
C++20 compiler support is required.

All code is released under the GPL - see the doc/LICENSE text file for full
details.

## Contact and Help

All comments and criticism and help welcome. Spent 20 years away from C++ (day
job these days is PHP/JS) but I'm really enjoying my time back with C++.

You can find me as *Typhon* on the C++ Help, SFML, and DungeonCrawlers.org
Discord Servers, or my email address is on the Splash Screen of the Game.
