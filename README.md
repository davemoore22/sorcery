# Sorcery: Shadows under Llylgamyn

An open source remake of Wizardry 1,2,3 (and 5) with infinite Dungeon
Adventures, and (optional) modern CRPG conveniences! I'm aiming to release it by
the end of the year. Its coded using C++20 and SFML. Whilst eventually
it will be fully 3D, I need to learn OpenGL in the meantime, and thus initially
the dungeons will be implemeted using the old-school Painters Algorithm method
used in classics such as Eye of the Beholder and Wizardry.

Its nowhere near complete or even playable yet! Visit back regularily for updates.

## What next?

Next stop is to get the party walking about properly. Eventually I'll do a
proper 3D render via OpenGL but for now I'm rendering the view via the Painter's
Algorithm, just like the old school dungeon crawlers did. Once that is fully
working, then its time items, creatures, and combat. Then there might be
something playable here!

Although the main focus is random dungeons much like Diablo, I want to
eventually remake the original games as optional sub-modules.

If you really want to try and compile the code, compilation instructions are in
the doc/COMPILE text file. It works on my machine anyway. Currently I use VSCode
(make in the base directory should work) and CodeBlocks on Linux (Ubuntu 20) to
do development on.

Code is released under the GPLv2.

## Contact and Help

All comments and criticism and help welcome. Spent 20 years away from C++ (day
job these days is PHP/JS) but I'm really enjoying working with modern CPP.

You can find me as *Typhon* on the C++ Help, SFML, and DungeonCrawlers.org
Discord Servers, or my email address is on the Splash Screen of the Game.
