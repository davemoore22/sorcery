# Sorcery

An open source remake/remaster initially of the classic CRPG Wizardry, Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord, then hopefully of the Sequels II (The Diamond Knight), III (Legacy of Llylgamyn), and V (Heart of the Maelstrom). Currently under heavy development with a release hopefully later in 2025.

~~Written using SFML, TGUI, and C++.~~

Written using ImGui/SDL2/OpenGL and C++
<br>(*Note that some re-engineering is currently in progress to move to a more flexible/easier-to-use UI stack This should not affect the aimed release date of late 2025!<p>For daily updates and progress on that see the [sdl/imgui branch](https://github.com/davemoore22/sorcery/tree/sdl/imgui)*)

**(Updated 14th May 2025)**

## Wishlist

* Sequels (II, III, V)
* Procedurally-Generated Infinite Content (like Diablo)
* Modding
* Plugin/3D Graphics

## What next? (as of November 2024)

Currently adding Item Usage/Invocation, as well as buying, selling, uncursing, and identifying at Boltac's. Normal inventory management has been mosty completed!

Initially I am planning to remake Wizardry 1, then adding 2 and 3, and then subsequently providing infinite procedurally-generated content like that of Diablo for example. In the meantime, check out Snarfu's bugfix and recompilation of the original Wizardry for Apple II at <https://github.com/snafaru>.

## Compilation

I'm currently developing solely on Linux (Ubuntu 22) so compilation instructions are currently Linux-specific. Windows instructions and releases will of course be supported at a later date.

Full compliation instructions for Linux are in the doc/COMPILE text file, but in brief both CMake (via VSCode CMake Tools) and Code::Blocks are supported once the various support libraries are installed. C++20 compiler support is required (I'm currently using GCC 11.3).

All code is released under the GPL - see the doc/LICENSE text file for full details.

## Contact and Help

All comments and criticism and help welcome. You can find me as *Typhon* on the C++ Help, SFML, and DungeonCrawlers.org Discord Servers, or my email address is on the Splash Screen of the Game.
