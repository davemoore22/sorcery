An open source remake of Wizardry 1,2,3 (and 5) with infinite Dungeon
Adventures, and (optional) modern CRPG conveniences! I'm aiming to release it by
the end of the year. Its coded using C++20 and SFML. Whilst eventually the game
engine will be fully 3D, I need to spend time learning OpenGL properly, and thus
initially the dungeons will be rendered (poorly!) using the old-school Painters
Algorithm method used in classics such as Eye of the Beholder and The Vard's
Tale. Its nowhere near complete or even playable yet! Visit back regularily for
updates.

## What can't you do? (as of May 2020)

* All the rest of it, but I'm working on it.

## What next? (as of May 2020)

Next stop will be items, creatures, magic and combat. Then there might be
something playable here! Then, a proper 3D renderer will be implemented.

Although the main focus is random dungeons much like Diablo, I want to
eventually remake the original games as optional sub-modules.

If you really want to try and compile the code, compilation instructions are in
the doc/COMPILE text file. It works on my machine anyway. Currently I use VSCode
(make in the base directory should work) and CodeBlocks on Linux (Ubuntu 20) to
do development on. No idea how to compile on Windows currently, but be assured
there will be a windows release.

Code is released under the GPLv2.

## Contact and Help

All comments and criticism and help welcome. Spent 20 years away from C++ (day
job these days is PHP/JS) but I'm really enjoying working with modern CPP.

You can find me as *Typhon* on the C++ Help, SFML, and DungeonCrawlers.org
Discord Servers, or my email address is on the Splash Screen of the Game.
