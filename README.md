# Sorcery: Shadows under Llylgamyn

An open source remake/remaster initially of the classic CRPG Wizardry, Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord, then of the sequels II (The Diamond Knight), III (Legacy of Llylgamyn), and V (Heart of the Maelstrom). Currently under heavy development with a release hopefully later in 2023.

Written using SFML, TGUI, and C++.

## Wishlist

## What next? (as of 31st January 2023)

I've started work on implementing Dungeon Events (such as finding keys and special messages). Character Inventory and Item-Handling will be the next thing to after I've implemented this. I intend to implement the special events on Floors 6 and 7 that by mistake were left out of the original versions of the game.

Initially I am planning to remake Wizardry 1, then adding 2 and 3, and then subsequently providing infinite procedurally-generated content like that of Diablo for example. In the meantime, check out Snarfu's bugfix and recompilation of the original Wizardry for Apple II at <https://github.com/snafaru>.

## Compilation

I 'm currently developing solely on Linux (Ubuntu 22) so compilation instructions are currently Linux-specific. Windows instructions and releases will of course be supported at a later date.

Full compliation instructions for Linux are in the doc/COMPILE text file, but in brief both CMake (via VSCode CMake Tools) and Code::Blocks are supported once the various support libraries are installed. C++20 compiler support is required (I'm currently using GCC 12.1).

All code is released under the GPL - see the doc/LICENSE text file for full details.

## Contact and Help

All comments and criticism and help welcome. You can find me as *Typhon* on the C++ Help, SFML, and DungeonCrawlers.org Discord Servers, or my email address is on the Splash Screen of the Game.
