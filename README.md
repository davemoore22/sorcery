# Sorcery: Shadows under Llylgamyn.

![Logo](/promo/screen1.png)

An open source remake of Wizardry 1,2,3 (and 5) with infinite Dungeon
Adventures, and (optional) modern CRPG conveniences! I'm aiming to release it by
the end of the year. Its coded using C++17/20(ish) and SFML.

Nowhere near complete or even playable yet! Visit back regularily for updates.

## What can't you do?

## What next?

Next stop is to add the dungeon and get the party walking about it. Then items,
creatures, and combat. Then there might be something playable here! Although the
main focus is random dungeons much like Diablo, I want to eventually remake
Wizardrys 1,2,3 and 5 as sub-modules.

If you really want to try and compile the code, compilation instructions are in
the doc/COMPILE text file. It works on my machine anyway. Currently I use VSCode
(make in the base directory should work) and CodeBlocks on Linux (Ubuntu 20) to
do development on.

Code is released under the GPLv2.

## Contact and Help

All comments and criticism and help welcome. Spent 20 years away from C++ (day
job these days is PHP/JS) but I'm really enjoying working with modern CPP.

You can find me as *Typhon* on the C++ Help, SFML, and DungeonCrawlers.org
Discord Servers, or my email address is on the Splash Screen of the Game.
