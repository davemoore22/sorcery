	"HINT_CHARACTER_RACE_DWARF":				"Dwarves are stronger, more pious, and considerably    #sturdier than Humans, though not as agile. They are    #often Fighters, Priests, or Samurai.",
	"HINT_CHARACTER_RACE_GNOME":				"Gnomes are slightly less clever and not as strong as  #Humans, but in comparison are often more pious and more#agile. They can be good Priests, Thieves, or even     #Samurai.",
	"HINT_CHARACTER_RACE_HOBBIT":				"Hobbits have the highest initial attribute total, but #that's because their luck starts out so much higher    #than any other race. Their strength and vitality are  #much less than Humans but they are very agile. They   #often end up being Thieves, Lords, or even Ninjas.",
	"HINT_CHARACTER_ALIGNMENT_GOOD":			"Good Characters will not (if alignment restrictions   #are enforced) voluntarily occupy a party with an Evil  #Character. Thieves cannot be of good alignment, and   #both Samurai and Lords must be.",

	"HINT_CHARACTER_ALIGNMENT_EVIL":			"Evil Characters will not (if alignment restrictions   #are enforced) voluntarily occupy a party with a Good   #Character. Only Evil Characterscan be Ninjas, and     #cannot be Samurai or Lords.",
	"HINT_CHARACTER_STAT_STRENGTH":				"A high Strength stat gives bonuses to a Character's   #melee hit chance probability and also adds additional  #damage on each melee and (if applicable) ranged       #attack.",
	"HINT_CHARACTER_STAT_INTELLIGENCE":			"A high Intelligence stat increases the chance for a   #Character to learn new Mage spells, and also improves  #the chance to identify unknown groups of Enemies in   #each round of combat.",
	"HINT_CHARACTER_STAT_PIETY":				"A high Piety stat increases the chance for a Character#to learn new Priest spells, and also improves the      #chance to identify unknown groups of Enemies in each  #round of combat.",
	"HINT_CHARACTER_STAT_VITALITY":				"A high Vitality stat increases the number of hit      #points a Character gains per level, and improves the   #chance for a Character to survive a Resurrection      #attempt.",
	"HINT_CHARACTER_STAT_AGILITY":				"A high Agility stat increases a Character's Initiative#allowing him or her to go first in battle, as well as  #giving bonuses to a character's ranged hit chance     #probability (if applicable), and increases the chance #to identify traps and to avoid triggering them on a#failed disarm attempt.",
	"HINT_CHARACTER_STAT_LUCK":					"A high Luck stat improves a Character's ability to    #resist hostile magic and negative status effects.'",
	"HINT_CHARACTER_CLASS_FIGHTER":				"A basic class, Fighters are typical warriors. They    #excel in combat and nothing else. Strength is their    #primary attribute. They are capable of equipping all  #manner of armour and weapons, and are typically       #capable of withstanding far greater amounts of     #damage then their fellow adventurers.",
	"HINT_CHARACTER_CLASS_MAGE":				"A basic class, Mages are spell casters; they are in   #many ways the opposite of a fighter. Their hand-to-hand#combat skills are terrible, as they can only wield    #light weapons, and any armor beyond a robe interferes #with their magic. I.Q. is their primary attribute. #They use this intelligence to learn the ability to tap#into mystical and arcane energies behind powerful     #offensive magic.",
	"HINT_CHARACTER_CLASS_PRIEST":				"A basic class, Priests are holy warriors for the gods #they worship and represent. Piety is their primary     #attribute. By keeping in good standing with their     #deities, they may call upon their assistance with     #prayer for miracles such as shining light upon     #darkness, or curing wounds received in combat. They   #may also dispel unholy creatures that have risen from #the dead. They may wear any armor, but they may carve  #the flesh of another, so they are restricted to blunt#weapons.Priests must have conviction, and may not be#Neutral.",
	"HINT_CHARACTER_CLASS_THIEF":				"A basic class, Thieves have moderate HP and fighting  #skills, but their speed enables them to excel in a     #variety of other talents. Agility is their primary    #attribute. They are capable of hiding in shadows and  #ambushing enemies from afar, and detecting traps   #hidden in chests; they may also disarm those traps to #obtain the riches inside. No other class may do this. #They can use an assortment of weapons as long as they  #are not too heavy, but they can wear no armor heavier#than leather, in order not to restrict their range  #of motion. Those who suffer from a guilty conscience#do not make good thieves, so they may not be Good.",
	"HINT_CHARACTER_CLASS_BISHOP":				"An elite class, Bishops are a cross between Priests   #and Mages. They are capable of learning spells from    #either class, however, as a penalty, they learn spells#at a much slower rate. They do, however, gain a slight#weapon and armor advantage over Mages. Since       #Bishops need to have their prayers heard by the gods, #they may not be Neutral.",
	"HINT_CHARACTER_CLASS_SAMURAI":				"An elite class,Samurai are a cross between a Fighter  #and a Mage. They possess all the skills of a Fighter,  #but they eventually learn to tap into the arcane arts #that permit them to cast Mage spells, albeit at a     #slower rate. Their strict code of honour does not  #command that they always do good, but it does instruct#them to do no intentional harm, so they may not be    #Evil.",
	"HINT_CHARACTER_CLASS_LORD":				"An elite class,Lords are, in many ways, hybrids of a  #Fighter and Priest. However, their first allegiance is #to the ways of warrior combat. As such, they are not  #granted the ability to dispel the undead. They will,  #however, have their prayers answered at higher     #levels, but they learn these prayers much more slowly #than a Priest. In order to receive the full blessing  #of the gods, a Lord must be Good.",
	"HINT_CHARACTER_CLASS_NINJA":				"An elite class, Ninjas are essentially, an upgraded   #Fighter. With the highest restrictions of any class,   #it is nearly impossible to access this powerful       #warrior. While they can fight well with any armor and #weapon, they actually perform substantially better #unarmed, capable of inflicting a higher percentage of #critical strikes that may instantly kill a foe. The   #Ninja code demands allegiance to no one other than the #clan theywere trained with, so Ninjas must be Evil.",
	"HINT_CONFIG_RECOMMENDED_MODE":				"A more gentle Gameplay and Graphic experience than#the original Wizardry I, II, and III Games",
