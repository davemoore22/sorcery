	"HINT_CHARACTER_STAT_PIETY":				"A high Piety stat increases the chance for a Character to learn new Priest spells, and also improves the chance to identify unknown groups of Enemies in each round of combat.",
	"HINT_CHARACTER_STAT_VITALITY":				"A high Vitality stat increases the number of hit points a Character gains per level, and improves the chance for a Character to survive a Resurrection attempt.",
	"HINT_CHARACTER_STAT_AGILITY":				"A high Agility stat increases a Character's Initiative allowing him or her to go first in battle, as well as giving bonuses to a Character's ranged hit chance probability (if applicable), and increases the chance to identify traps and to avoid triggering them on a failed disarm attempt.",
	"HINT_CHARACTER_STAT_LUCK":					"A high Luck stat improves a Character's ability to resist hostile magic and negative status effects.'",
	"HINT_CHARACTER_CLASS_FIGHTER":				"A basic Class, Fighters are typical warriors. They excel in combat and nothing else. Strength is their primary attribute. They are capable of equipping all manner of armour and weapons, and are typically capable of withstanding far greater amounts of damage then their fellow adventurers.",
	"HINT_CHARACTER_CLASS_MAGE":				"A basic Class, Mages are spell casters; they are in many ways the opposite of a fighter. Their hand-to-hand combat skills are terrible, as they can only wield light weapons, and any armor beyond a robe interferes with their magic. I.Q. is their primary attribute. They use this intelligence to learn the ability to tap into mystical and arcane energies behind powerful offensive magic.",
	"HINT_CHARACTER_CLASS_PRIEST":				"A basic Class, Priests are holy warriors for the gods they worship and represent. Piety is their primary attribute. By keeping in good standing with their deities, they may call upon their assistance with prayer for miracles such as shining light upon darkness, or curing wounds received in combat. They may also dispel unholy creatures that have risen from the dead. They may wear any armor, but they may carve the flesh of another, so they are restricted to blunt weapons. Priests must have conviction, and may not be Neutral.",
	"HINT_CHARACTER_CLASS_THIEF":				"A basic Class, Thieves have moderate HP and fighting skills, but their speed enables them to excel in a variety of other talents. Agility is their primary attribute. They are capable of hiding in shadows and ambushing enemies from afar, and detecting traps hidden in chests; they may also disarm those traps to obtain the riches inside. No other Class may do this. They can use an assortment of weapons as long as they are not too heavy, but they can wear no armor heavier than leather, in order not to restrict their range of motion. Those who suffer from a guilty conscience do not make good thieves, so they may not be Good.",
	"HINT_CHARACTER_CLASS_BISHOP":				"An elite Class, Bishops are a cross between Priests and Mages. They are capable of learning spells from either Class, however, as a penalty, they learn spells at a much slower rate. They do, however, gain a slight weapon and armor advantage over Mages. Since Bishops need to have their prayers heard by the gods, they may not be Neutral.",
	"HINT_CHARACTER_CLASS_SAMURAI":				"An elite Class,Samurai are a cross between a Fighter and a Mage. They possess all the skills of a Fighter, but they eventually learn to tap into the arcane arts that permit them to cast Mage spells, albeit at a slower rate. Their strict code of honour does not command that they always do good, but it does instruct them to do no intentional harm, so they may not be Evil.",
	"HINT_CHARACTER_CLASS_LORD":				"An elite Class,Lords are, in many ways, hybrids of a Fighter and Priest. However, their first allegiance is to the ways of warrior combat. As such, they are not granted the ability to dispel the undead. They will, however, have their prayers answered at higher levels, but they learn these prayers much more slowly than a Priest. In order to receive the full blessing of the gods, a Lord must be Good.",
	"HINT_CHARACTER_CLASS_NINJA":				"An elite Class, Ninjas are essentially, an upgraded Fighter. With the highest restrictions of any Class, it is nearly impossible to access this powerful warrior. While they can fight well with any armor and  weapon, they actually perform substantially better unarmed, capable of inflicting a higher percentage of critical strikes that may instantly kill a foe. The Ninja code demands allegiance to no one other than the clan theywere trained with, so Ninjas must be Evil.",
	"HINT_CONFIG_RECOMMENDED_MODE":				"A more gentle gameplay and graphic experience than the original Wizardry I, II, and III (and include gameplay enhancements from Wizardry V).",
	"HINT_CONFIG_STRICT_MODE":					"All gameplay and grahics options emulate the graphics settings and difficultly of the original Wizardry I, II, and III games.",
	"HINT_CONFIG_CHEAT_MODE":					"Enable Wizard Mode, and allow permanent Character death or loss to be avoided.",
	"HINT_CONFIG_AUTO_SAVE":					"Game status/progress saved to disk after every move/encounter.",

	"HINT_GAME_STAT_LOSS_LEVEL_GAIN":			"Allow a chance of Character stats to drop when gaining a level.",
	"HINT_GAME_REROLL_HIT_POINTS":				"Reroll all hit dice when gaining a level; this can often result in +1 hp when gaining a level.",
	"HINT_GAME_STAT_RESET_CLASS_CHANGE":		"When changing Class, reset Character stats to racial minimums.",
	"HINT_GAME_AGING_CLASS_CHANGE":				"Characters age a number of years when changing Class.",
	"HINT_GAME_PROTECT_TELEPORT":				"Attempting to teleport into rock will result in a failed teleport instead of losing Characters.",
	"HINT_GAME_ALLOW_RANGED_WEAPONS":			"Allow Characters to buy, sell, equip, and use ranged and reach weaponry (from Wizardry V)",
	"HINT_GAME_SPELL_CASTING_SURPRISE_ROUND":	"Allow Characters (and enemies!) to cast spells in the combat surprise round at the beginning of an encounter.",

	"HINT_GAME_REROLL_ONES":					"Low dice rolls on healing spells or hit dice rolls (such as 1s or 2s) will be rerolled.",
	"HINT_GAME_ALLOW_LOST_LEGATED": 			"Allow lost Characters to be legated (from Wizardry III).",
	"HINT_GAME_ALLOW_CURABLE_DRAIN": 			"Instead of being permanent, drained levels only give a temporary penalty, and can be restored at the Temple for a hefty fee.",
	"HINT_GAME_ALLOW_SHARED_INVENTORY": 		"Instead of individual purses/inventories, the current Party shares one pooled purse/inventory.",
	"HINT_GAME_CAMPING_SPELL_POINTS": 			"Camping in the Dungeon in a suitable location will restore all spellpoints (this will unbalance gameplay!).",
	"HINT_GAME_CHARGED_ITEMS": 					"Instead of having a fixed chance to break on each use/invocation, appropriate Items now have charges.",
